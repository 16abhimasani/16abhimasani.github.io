This page exists to demonstrate the visual styles of the various elements that comprise the design of this site.

## Heading Level 2

Second level headings are used to split text into sections. First level headings are only used once per page, in the page or post title. [Hyperlinks](/styleguide) are underlined and coloured when hovered.

### Heading Level 3
Third level headings are most often used to denote names rather than sections, so have a lower visual priority.

#### Heading Level 4

Fourth level headings are used to split-up longer text into smaller sub-sections. Headings should be short and descriptive of the content they contain.

## Adjacent Heading Level 2

### To a Sibling Heading Level 3

Adjacent headings of decending levels remove the `margin-top` from the younger sibling heading to reduce spacing.

## Typographic Styles

### Ordered List

- Ordered Lists look like this.
- Multi-leveled Ordered Lists look like this:
	- This is an example of a second-level bullet

### Unordered List

1. This is a Unordered List.
2. Unordered Lists can also have multiple levels:
	1. This is a second-level Unordered List item

### Blockquote

Blockquotes are used to "pullout" content and quotes to give them visual dominance, and therefore, impact to whatever text they feature.

> This is a blockquote of featured text that has been pulled out of paragraph content

### Code

Inline `code` examples are styled with a monospace typeface and are coloured.

Codeblocks have syntax highlighting using [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge)
