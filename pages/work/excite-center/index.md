title: Internship @Drexel ExCITe Center

Over the summer of 2015, I worked with Dr. Kim and other Drexel STAR students on several projects in order to get a broad exposure to Robotics, Machine Learning, Audio processing, and more. The first project I worked on was to program Parrot AR Drones to fly autonomously to a choreographed dance routine as part of a dance exhibit in New York. The process was quite difficult because at the time I had very little programming knowledge but I was able to quickly pick it up with help of the other students. After working on this, I bounced between the HUBO Humanoid Robot project and the Magnetic Resonator Piano (MRP) project. The HUBO project required some 3D printing work so I was able to help with that because of my experience with tuning my XYZ DaVinci 1.0 (I posted this research as an archive post under ["Blog"](http://ash.bhimasani.com/)). The purpose of the MRP project was build and program an LED lighting strip above the keyboard to display colored attributes to notes being played such as vibrato, velocity, etc. Another part of this project was using Max MSP to create an automatic light show to music being played.
