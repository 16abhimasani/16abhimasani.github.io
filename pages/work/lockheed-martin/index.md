title: Internship @Lockheed Martin Space Systems
---

Over the summer of 2015, I shadowed  Gregory J. Staszowski, a Systems Engineering Manager, on his work with the Air Force concerning defensive space systems. At Lockheed, I spent most of my time attending technical engineering meetings concerning ongoing projects, talking with engineers about what they do and how it has changed over the years, and learning how an engineering company operates. Most of the things they showed me were categorized as highly sensitive so I was unable to take notes or pictures of the facilities and I can't discuss specifics of the projects.
