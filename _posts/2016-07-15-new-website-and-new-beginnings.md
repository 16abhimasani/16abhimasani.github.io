Today I'm launching my new personal website which will act as a fresh slate as I head to Georgia Tech this fall. This new site, running on Jekyll through GitHub pages is a complete overhaul from my previous site which ran on the ghost blogging platform. It was slow, expensive, and just cluttered with projects I did as a kid. My old site was definitely useful because it allowed me to keep a track of how far I come and provided an easy outlet to publish my 3D printing research on the XYZ DaVinci 1.0. My latest project (Cycle3D) has been a continuation of this interest as well. Now that I'm building this "all-in-one" portfolio. I will be publishing everything here to make it easy for myself and others to see my work.   

On top of this, I also wanted to use this site as a more creative outlet for my interests in the visual arts. I have been experimenting with photography, film, graphic design, writing, music, painting, drawing, and sculpting recently so this site will serve as a medium to publish my finished work (definitely rough around the edges).

With this intention, I am neither an exceptional artist or a dignified maker but I plan to earn both of these titles.
