I just wanted to make a post about the first few weeks at GT as a way to solidify my direction. During the first couple days, I unexpectedly joined the fraternity Lambda Chi Alpha and, looking back, I'm glad I did. I'm sure that ΛΧΑ will open a ton of opportunities in the near future for me to really propel myself. Besides this, I've tried to join as many clubs as possible which is definitely not going to work 😣 (GT Web-Dev, GT iOS Club, The Agency, GreyHat, Design Club, VG Dev, Big Data Club, BuzzStudios, Pottery Club). The most important thing to me is to not let go of any of my interests because "I don't have time." I think this is a very good excuse and a totally valid one to give myself but I would be more satisfied just working harder to meet all my extracurricular interests.

I think the environment here also fits my style better. Back home I would go to school from 7:45 am to 2:30 pm and come home feeling either tired or lazy with the knowledge that I have potentially 9 hours until I have to sleep and do it all over again. Here it's completely different. Even though I only have 5 hours of classes in a school day, every minute feels like it counts which is pressure that I personally enjoy ⛷.

Overall, I'm extremely excited for my first year at Georgia Tech and cannot even imagine where I'll be by the summer of 2017.
