Recently I've been diving deep into the cryptocurrency world. The technology has been fascinating me since the very first time I bought Bitcoin back in 2013 when it just over $500. Nearly 4 years later, I start seeing articles on Facebook feed about a new currency called Ethereum that was supposed to outperform Bitcoin in every way. This spark was the kickoff to my summer semester at Tech; I realized that I was forgoing income by not interning and instead taking classes so I was committed to idea of creating cash flow for myself through investing and freelance development. My first transaction buying Ether on Coinbase was my first step into the "wild west" of the cryptocurrency world. Over the course of the summer I began heavily trading cryptos (everything from  BTC and ETH to lesser know alt coins like NEO), jumping around from exchange to exchange. In span of 3 months, I moved from Coinbase to Kraken to Gemini to Bittrex just to keep up with a market that was exploding in popularity. The ongoing ICO craze was fascinating to watch in real time as companies were fundraising millions of dollars in a manner of minutes. Watching a brand new market grow exponentially before my eyes with constant innovation around the corner has solidified my intention of working in this space and adding this to innovation.

We quickly realized from our rapid trades that we unable to track how much money we were making simply because some exchanges did not include BTC price stamps on completed orders so it became ambiguous to us how to calculate our portfolio value. This lack of easy to access information essentially forced me to keep an excel sheet of all my open orders and closed orders with all necessary information to do the calculations. Obviously this was extremely painful to constantly keep up to date and I eventually abandoned the document.

Unsurprisingly, my friends, who were also trading, started asking me for a recommendation on how to keep track of everything. Blockfolio wasn't adequate because it made adding positions messy and difficult to understand. Lawnmower slightly improved on this but still lacked any functionality without signing into an exchange. I realized from the obvious need and lack of robust solutions that we could easily create an app to meet this basic functionality.

The idea grew into a more ambitious plan of using the project as Cowboy Killers' stepping stone into the world of cryptocurrency, allowing us to both release a polished product into the world and build an audience for ourselves.

Currently, we are in the development phase of this project, mostly working on creating a beautiful interface that people want to open again and again throughout the day. After this, we have many ideas on how to extend the platform organically and build our brand. Web app designs coming soon!

Below is some designs of the current interface:

The logo is still in the works but we're bouncing around some moon related imagery. The closed circles on the position page represent closed positions and the open circles represent open positions. The row with numbers like Avg. Cost, Balance, and Total Equity will be slidable similar to Robinhood's interface. In fact, I modeled much of the designs here around a mix of Robinhood and what you would expect out of a crypto app. The reason for this is to maximize the usability and make the navigation and experience as elegant as possible. I'll be publishing a full design showcase on Behance as well as a case study into the iOS app on my website once everything is finalized and ready for release.

Again, this is just the beginning for both Selene and Cowboy Killers, we're looking forward to debuting our more ambitious efforts in the near future.
